PromptEngineering Learning Google Research has Introduced the Finetuned Langauge models are zero shot learners(FLAN).

📃 ResearchPaper : https://lnkd.in/dXUxxHyj

🧑‍💻 Code : https://lnkd.in/d4CBWpZH

🚀 INTERESTING FACTS:
------------------------
🔸 The paper explores a simple method for improving the zero-shot learning abilities of language models by instruction tuning.

🔸 The instruction-tuned model, FLAN, outperforms zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 evaluated datasets and even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ.

🔸 The authors hope that their paper will spur further research on instructions-based NLP, zero-shot learning, and using labeled data to improve large language models.

🕵️‍♀️ IMPORTANCE:
------------------------
🔹 The paper presents a simple yet effective method for improving the zero-shot learning abilities of language models.

🔹 The instruction tuning approach used in the paper can help language models to perform better on unseen tasks without requiring any additional training data.

🔹 This approach can reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming data labeling efforts, making it more cost-effective and efficient.

🔹 The results of the paper show that FLAN, the instruction-tuned model, outperforms zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 evaluated datasets and even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ.

🔹 This suggests that instruction tuning has great potential to improve the performance of large language models at scale.

🔹 The paper's findings could have significant implications for natural language processing (NLP) applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and machine translation systems.

🔹 The authors hope that their work will spur further research on instructions-based NLP, zero-shot learning, and using labeled data to improve large language models.
